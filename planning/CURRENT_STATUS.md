4. Profile management
5. App settings

4. No loading states in some areas
5. No offline support

## Environment Status
- Expo app running

## Summary
The app has a solid foundation with database, auth, and basic group functionality working. However, the core habit tracking and financial features that make this app unique are not yet implemented. The next priority should be implementing the habit system as it's the core value proposition of the app.
